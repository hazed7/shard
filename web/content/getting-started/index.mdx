# Download & Install

## macOS

1. Download the latest `.dmg` file from the [download page](/download)
2. Open the DMG and drag Shard Launcher to your Applications folder
3. Launch Shard from Applications

> **Note**: On first launch, macOS may show a security warning. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Windows & Linux

Windows and Linux builds are coming soon. In the meantime, you can [build from source](/docs/building).

## Verifying Downloads

Each release includes SHA-256 checksums. To verify your download:

```bash
# macOS
shasum -a 256 Shard-Launcher-*.dmg

# Compare with the checksum in CHECKSUMS.txt from the release
```

## Data Location

Shard stores all data in `~/.shard/`:
