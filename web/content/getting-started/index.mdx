# Download & Install

## macOS

1. Download the latest `.dmg` file from the [download page](/download)
2. Open the DMG and drag Shard Launcher to your Applications folder
3. Launch Shard from Applications

> **Note**: On first launch, macOS may show a security warning. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Windows

1. Download the latest `.msi` or `.exe` file from the [download page](/download)
2. Run the installer or execute the portable `.exe`
3. Launch Shard from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

## Linux

1. Download the latest `.AppImage` or `.deb` file from the [download page](/download)
2. For AppImage: Make it executable (`chmod +x Shard-Launcher-*.AppImage`) and run
3. For Debian/Ubuntu: Install with `sudo dpkg -i Shard-Launcher-*.deb`

## Verifying Downloads

Each release includes SHA-256 checksums. To verify your download:

```bash
# macOS
shasum -a 256 Shard-Launcher-*.dmg

# Compare with the checksum in CHECKSUMS.txt from the release
```

## CLI (Optional)

The CLI is a separate tool for scripting and automation. The desktop app and CLI share the same data directory, so profiles and accounts work with both.

```bash
# Build and install CLI
cd launcher
cargo install --path .

# Now available as `shard` command
shard --help
```

See the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) for full documentation.

## Data Location

Shard stores all data in `~/.shard/`. Both the desktop app and CLI use this directory:

```
~/.shard/
├── store/          # Content-addressed storage (mods, packs)
├── profiles/       # Profile manifests
├── instances/      # Materialized game directories
├── minecraft/      # Versions, libraries, assets
├── accounts.json   # Account tokens
└── config.json     # Launcher settings
```
