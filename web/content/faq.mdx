## What platforms are supported?

Currently Shard is available for macOS. Windows and Linux support is planned for future releases.

## Does it support modded Minecraft?

Yes! Shard supports Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge loaders. You can browse and install mods from Modrinth and CurseForge directly within the launcher.

## How does content deduplication work?

When you add a mod or resource pack, Shard computes its SHA-256 hash and stores it in a content-addressed store. If another profile uses the same mod, it simply references the existing file. No copies are made.

## Can I use my existing Minecraft account?

Yes, Shard uses Microsoft OAuth authentication. Your existing Microsoft account works seamlessly, and you can add multiple accounts.

## Is Shard open source?

Yes, Shard is fully open source. The core library is written in Rust, and the desktop app uses Tauri with React. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Th0rgal/shard) for the source code.

## Where is my data stored?

All data is stored locally in `~/.shard/`. This includes profiles, the content store, Minecraft data, and your account tokens.
