# Welcome to Shard

Shard is a minimal, content-addressed Minecraft launcher focused on stability, reproducibility, and low duplication. It features a core library and CLI written in Rust, with an optional desktop UI built with Tauri and React.

## Philosophy

- **Single source of truth**: Profiles are declarative manifests; instances are derived artifacts
- **Deduplication first**: Mods and packs live in a content-addressed store (SHA-256); profiles only reference hashes
- **Stable + boring**: Plain JSON on disk, predictable layout, no magic state
- **Replaceable parts**: Authentication, Minecraft data, and profile management are isolated modules
- **CLI-first**: Everything is designed to be scripted and composed

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release from the [download page](/download)
2. **Open** Shard Launcher
3. **Sign in** with your Microsoft account
4. **Create a profile** and start playing!

See the [Installation](/docs/getting-started) guide for detailed instructions.

## Features

### Profile Management

Create and manage multiple profiles with different Minecraft versions, mod loaders, and content. Each profile is a declarative JSON manifest that can be versioned and shared.

### Content-Addressed Storage

Mods, resource packs, and shader packs are stored by their SHA-256 hash. If multiple profiles use the same content, it's only stored once on disk.

### Mod Platform Integration

Browse and install mods directly from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) and [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com). Shard handles version compatibility and dependencies automatically.

### Multi-Account Support

Add multiple Microsoft accounts and switch between them easily. Each account's tokens are stored securely.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (Windows and Linux coming soon)
- **Java 17+** for Minecraft (Shard can help you install this)
- A **Microsoft account** for Minecraft authentication
