# Content Store

The content store is Shard's deduplicated storage for mods, resource packs, and shader packs.

## Location

```
~/.shard/store/
├── mods/sha256/
│   ├── a3f2e1d4...
│   └── b7c8d9e0...
├── resourcepacks/sha256/
└── shaderpacks/sha256/
```

## How It Works

1. **Hash**: When you add content, Shard computes its SHA-256 hash
2. **Store**: The file is stored at `store/<type>/sha256/<hash>`
3. **Reference**: Profiles reference content by hash, not by path

### Example

When you install Sodium:

1. Shard downloads `sodium-fabric-0.6.5+mc1.21.4.jar`
2. Computes hash: `sha256:a3f2e1d4...`
3. Stores at `~/.shard/store/mods/sha256/a3f2e1d4...`
4. Adds reference to your profile

If another profile also uses Sodium, it references the same hash. No duplicate storage.

## Benefits

### Deduplication

If you have 10 profiles using Sodium, the file is stored once. This can save gigabytes of disk space for modded setups.

### Integrity

The hash guarantees the file hasn't been corrupted. If the hash doesn't match, Shard knows something is wrong.

### Safe Cleanup

Shard can safely remove unreferenced content:

```bash
shard store gc
```

This scans all profiles and removes content no longer referenced by any profile.

## Library

The library is a higher-level view of the content store:

- Browse all content you've ever downloaded
- See which profiles use each item
- Re-add content to new profiles without re-downloading

Access the library in the desktop app via the sidebar, or use the CLI:

```bash
# List library contents
shard library list

# List mods only
shard library list --type mods

# Show item details
shard library show <hash>
```

Content Store Statistics
========================
Mods:          45 files (1.2 GB)
Resource Packs: 8 files (512 MB)
Shader Packs:   3 files (128 MB)
Total:         56 files (1.8 GB)

Deduplication savings: 2.4 GB (57%)
