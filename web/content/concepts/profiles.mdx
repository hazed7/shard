# Profiles

Shard is built around a few key concepts that make it different from other launchers. The flow is:

```
Profile (manifest) → Content Store (blobs) → Instance (game dir) → Launch
```

1. **Profiles** define what you want: Minecraft version, loader, mods
2. The **[Content Store](/docs/concepts/content-store)** holds the actual files, deduplicated by hash
3. **[Instances](/docs/concepts/instances)** are materialized game directories, ready to run
4. **Launch** starts Minecraft with the right arguments

A profile is a declarative manifest that describes a complete Minecraft setup.

## Profile Location

Profiles are stored in `~/.shard/profiles/<profile-id>/`:

```
~/.shard/profiles/
└── my-survival-world/
    ├── profile.json      # The manifest
    └── overrides/        # Profile-specific files
```

## Profile Manifest

A `profile.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "version": "1.21.4",
  "loader": {
    "type": "fabric",
    "version": "0.16.9"
  },
  "mods": [
    {
      "hash": "sha256:a3f2e1d4...",
      "name": "Sodium",
      "enabled": true,
      "source": {
        "platform": "modrinth",
        "project_id": "AANobbMI",
        "version_id": "mc1.21.4-0.6.5"
      }
    }
  ],
  "resourcepacks": [],
  "shaderpacks": []
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `version` | Minecraft version (e.g., "1.21.4") |
| `loader` | Optional mod loader configuration |
| `loader.type` | "fabric", "forge", "neoforge", or null for vanilla |
| `loader.version` | Loader version |
| `mods` | Array of mod references |
| `resourcepacks` | Array of resource pack references |
| `shaderpacks` | Array of shader pack references |

## Content References

Each mod/pack reference includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hash` | SHA-256 hash of the file (links to content store) |
| `name` | Display name |
| `enabled` | Whether to include in instance |
| `source` | Where this came from (Modrinth, CurseForge, local) |

## Overrides

The `overrides/` directory contains profile-specific files that aren't in the content store:

- Config files you've customized
- World saves (if stored with profile)
- Other files you want per-profile

These are copied into the instance directory at launch.

## Profile Operations

### Clone

Create a copy of a profile with all its content references:

```bash
shard profile clone "Original" "New Profile"
```

### Diff

Compare two profiles to see what's different:

```bash
shard profile diff "Profile A" "Profile B"
```

### Export

Export a profile for sharing (coming soon).

## CLI Commands

```bash
# List profiles
shard profile list

# Create a profile
shard profile create "Name" --mc 1.21.4 --loader fabric

# Delete a profile
shard profile delete "Name"

# Show profile details
shard profile show "Name"
```
